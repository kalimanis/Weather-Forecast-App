  Weather Forecast Application

Weather Forecast Application 🌦️
================================

Running the Application and Installing Dependencies
---------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies:

*   🏗️ **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
*   📡 **Requests**: A simple, yet elegant HTTP library in Python.
*   💾 **SQLite3**: Used for the local database.

### Installation and Running:

1.  Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2.  Install Flask and Requests if you haven't already:
    
        pip install Flask requests
    
3.  Run the Flask application:
    
        python final.py
    

Short Report 📝
---------------

**Overall Process:** The task involved creating a weather forecast application using Flask, which fetched data from the Meteomatics API, stored it in an SQLite database, and provided various endpoints for data access and visualization. The application needed to handle user inputs for dynamic data querying and ensure data integrity and security.

**Key Decisions:**

*   🌐 API Integration: Chose to integrate the Meteomatics weather API for real-time weather data due to its comprehensive documentation and ease of use.
*   🗃️ Database Choice: Opted for SQLite due to its simplicity and the fact that it requires no separate server process, which suits the scope of this application.
*   🛠️ Flask Framework: Selected for its simplicity in setting up web servers and endpoints, which facilitated quick development and testing.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

*   📈 API Rate Limits: Encountered issues with API rate limits. Solved by caching responses and limiting fetch frequency.
*   📊 Data Structure: Determining the most efficient database schema to store and query weather data. Resolved by normalizing data into separate tables for locations and forecasts.
*   🔒 Security: Ensuring the secure storage of API credentials. Resolved by storing credentials outside of the main script and ignoring sensitive files from version control.
*   📋 User Input Handling: Implementing error handling and validation for dynamic user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other malicious activities.

**Unexpected Issues:**

*   🕰️ Timezone inconsistencies between the API data and user local time were addressed by converting all times to UTC.
*   🔄 Dynamic Front End Updates: Encountered difficulties in dynamically updating the front end with new data without reloading the page, which led to exploring AJAX and Flask's jsonify.

**Problems and Solutions:**

*   🚀 Deployment Issues: Had issues with deploying the application due to environmental differences between development and production. Solved by using environment variables and testing deployment in a staging environment.
*   📚 Large Datasets: Handling large datasets and ensuring application performance led to implementing pagination for data displayed on the frontend.

**Tools and Techniques Used:**

*   🖥️ Flask for backend and API management.
*   🎨 HTML/CSS, Bootstrap for frontend styling.
*   📦 SQLite for database management.
*   📂 Git for version control and collaboration.
*   🧪 Postman for API testing and validation.
